<div class="title"><h1>The Living Labs of METROFOOD-IT</h1></div>

<p>Agrifood is one of the major sectors contributing to pressures on planetary boundaries by affecting biogeochemical cycles, climate, ecosystems, and biodiversity with about a third of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the global level. METROFOOD-IT will run Living Labs as a co-creative space for co-designing, experiencing, and assessing new solutions in support to more sustainable agrifood systems.</p>
<p>The <strong>Agrifood Fab Lab</strong> hosted by the Santa Chiara Lab of the University of Siena (Italy) is a Living Lab promoted by METROFOOD-IT that aims to provide solutions and to boost innovation and sustainability in the Italian Agrifood sector through co-creation activities to engage all the relevant stakeholders. It consists of an immersive physical and online space aimed at inspiring the principles of sustainability of the agrifood sector. A wide range of stakeholder and relevant actors in agrifood are engaged in research, education, demonstration and co-creation of activities thanks to the tools and facilities as a Hydroponic Lab, a Kitchen Lab, a Packaging Lab and a Traceability Lab. The Agrifood Fab Lab represents an innovative environment focused on user communities embedded within “real life” situations.</p>
<p>The <strong>Idro Lab</strong> is a Hydroponics and Aeroponics laboratory based on the principle of Vertical Farming, a cultivation technology in indoor, soilless and multi-level environments, which allows the control via sensors of all the variables that determine the growth process of the plant.</p>

<p>The <strong>Packaging Lab</strong> is a research and implementation laboratory of innovative technologies for the creation of sustainable packaging.</p>

<p>The <strong>Kitchen Lab</strong> is a laboratory space for experimenting and prototyping personalized food produced with 3D printing technologies. It responds promptly to the needs of people that require personalized nutrition in terms of quantity, presence of nutrients, consistency and shape and innovative diet.</p>

<p>The <strong>Traceability Lab</strong> is a laboratory that aims to support companies in defining the origin of products, their quality and the traceability of processes within the value chain as well as to set up and adopt a methodology to measure the performance of sustainability.</p>

<p>The <strong>Circular bioeconomy lab</strong> of the OU ENEA5 has the ambition to network groups of companies (large, small, innovative and start-ups) that interpret a prospective vision of a new model of economic development, for a smart, inclusive and sustainable use of technologies and that fits into the priority innovation area "health of Man and the environment- green and blue economy" identified for example by the Puglia Region in the Smart Specialization strategy. The companies involved belong to very different supply chains that, by seizing the challenge issued by regional innovation policies, to overcome their own boundaries of their respective technological trajectories, and in a synergistic matching action, can develop knowledge and change, intercepting regional innovation needs pertaining to two different social challenges:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sustainable Cities and Territories,</strong> whose need being addressed is to "strengthen technologies, processes, services and products to enable the transition to a green economy through eco-innovation" that will enable, first and foremost, companies to acquire skills to develop new products (bioplastics, bio-packaging) from dairy industry waste that has a significant impact on the environment (since it is often mismanaged). The communication activity, in addition to enhancing nationally and internationally the potential offered by this new model, will go a long way toward raising awareness among industry players in supporting and encouraging the shift toward a green economy, which can also come through the adoption of eco-innovations such as bio packaging.</li>
  <li><strong>Food security and sustainable agriculture,</strong> declined in the requirement to "foster the bio-economy for bio-industries." The key concept, in fact, is that of the circular economy, which starts from the agribusiness, that of the dairy sector, but can be extended to other processes of food processing (E.g., wastewater from the olive sector such as vegetation water from milling processes, or wastewater from the vine-wine sector). The proposed LL model thus goes to support "a sustainable and competitive agri-food industry," where this need intercepted not only by the Apulia Region where the infrastructure is physically present as a signal on which to activate innovations, but also extendable to the entire national and European territory.</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, the Circular bioeconomy lab of the ENEA5 OU intends to place itself in line with the most advanced EU guidelines on support for a circular economy for sustainable growth, whose companies are seizing the opportunity to work in a network to develop, in the field of "Advanced Materials" a new technology related to the development of materials for a sustainable industry. Hence, the Key Enabling Technology on which the offer is developed, has the ambitious goal of initiating a new possibility, of a biomaterial that can be used for the packaging of food products, with particular reference to dairy products, from which the raw-second material for innovative biopackaging originates, thus helping to reduce environmental impact and pressure on natural resources. All while producing healthy, safe products that enable people to have a varied diet that contains a balanced and adequate combination of energy and nutrients to ensure good health (new dairy products enriched in biopeptides).</p>
<p>In line with the proposed objectives, the LL Circular bioeconomy of the ENEA5 OU is positioned as an interface of its research and proposed services straddling two macro areas of regional interest "sustainable manufacturing" and "human and environmental health."</p>
<p>To achieve the presented objectives, thanks to the ongoing LL upgrade, it will be possible to monitor the different stages of the proposed process through qualitative-quantitative testing of the generated products by providing a range of data on the chemical-physical characterization of the extracted biomolecules, the consistency of the generated products, but also through microbiological testing, food safety assessment.</p>
