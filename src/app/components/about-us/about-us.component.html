            METROFOOD-IT Project
    </ng-template>
    <div class="mat-tab-content">The project aims to develop the organizational and operational framework of METROFOOD-IT, a research infrastructure for the agri-food sector. The project will implement the infrastructure and provide services to users via Transnational Access (TNA) and Virtual Access (VA), both physical and remote. The project will also define the strategy, procedures, and supporting system for the service provision. The services offered by the infrastructure will enable the interaction between research and innovation, industrial players, and consumers. The project will also support the development of sustainable and innovative agrifood systems, food safety, healthy diets, and solutions for a circular bio-economy.<br/><br/>

      The project targets four main categories of users: research/academic, policy makers/inspection and control agencies, food business operators, consumers/consumer associations. Moreover, the project will involve companies, citizens, inspection and control agencies, policymakers, and local authorities in co-creation and multi-actor approach initiatives. The project will engage stakeholders and users through an open innovation hub based on Living Labs, which will include face-to-face and virtual sessions, as well as demonstrations of the technological services offered. The project will also focus on education and training by designing dedicated programmes and solutions to position the infrastructure as a booster of knowledge and skills development.<br/><br/>

      The project will work on the electronic component of the infrastructure and its integration with the physical component to provide services to support the digitization of agri-food systems. The project will address the challenges of quality & safety, traceability, food transparency, sustainability and system resilience in the agri-food sector and the circular economy.<br/><br/>

      Four main categories of users can be identified, namely: research/academic, policy makers/inspection and control agencies, food business operators, consumers/consumer associations. Furthermore, companies can be directly involved, together with citizens, inspection and control agencies, policy makers and local authorities, in co-creation and multi-actor approach initiatives. Stakeholder and user engagement is pursued along with the implementation of an open innovation hub based on Living Labs, including face-to-face and virtual sessions, as well as demonstrators of the technological services offered. A specific focus is given to education and training, by defining dedicated programmes and solutions to position the infrastructure as booster of knowledge and skills development.<br/><br/>

      The Project focuses on the electronic component of the infrastructure and its integration with the physical component, to provide services to support the digitization of agri-food systems for quality & safety, traceability, food transparency, sustainability and system resilience agri-food and the circular economy.

      Our Mission
    </ng-template>
    <div class="mat-tab-content">
      To support research and innovation in the agrifood by providing integrated services, boosting the digitalization of agrifood systems and their efficiency, traceability, and sustainability, increasing the reliability of products and processes and information provided to citizens, authorities, and food system actors.
      <br/><br/>
      <img class="images" src="/access-portal-metrofood-it/assets/metrology_mg.jpg" alt="WP" width="80%">
      <br/><br/>
      METROFOOD-IT will promote the acceleration of scientific discovery, innovation and competitiveness, growth and jobs, economic and social cohesion. It will contribute to a new research approach that allows metrological data flows through networks in a way that will facilitate trade, competitiveness, quality and consumer satisfaction of food and nutrition data at the national level, but also in Europe and beyond. The RI will foster competitiveness in the Food & Health domain in many ways, especially through its unique technical and scientific offer. Some practical examples:
      <ol>
        <li>The attribution of quality indexes to food is a key element to address and benefit the research in the food industry, as well as to promote products through the assignment of trademarks to protect origin.</li>
        <li>Considering agricultural techniques at a low environmental impact or biological agriculture, the knowledge of nutritional and health characteristics, apart from the verification of contamination absence, can better support the attribution of added value to products.</li>
        <li>The RI operation can aid the agrifood industries, particularly SMEs, to solve their issues applying innovative technologies to successfully reach the market.</li>
        <li>The RI can permit to enforce consumers’ trust and awareness, and the establishment of a virtuous circle of supply and demand, which contribute to the promotion of production authenticity and quality.</li>
      </ol>

      Positive outcomes are also related to the accessibility, collection and reliability of big data, with advantages in terms of: reduced costs, improvement of data quality and integrity, availability of reliable data in real-time; reduction in the time between action and monitoring; building of public trust in the data, and expansion of the people’s ability to use them.

                  <h4><strong>Description</strong></h4>
                  <p>The OU Smart spectroscopical sensors and IoT applies spectroscopical techniques, in general, and laser photoacoustic spectroscopy (LPAS), in particular, to the quality control of the agri-food chain.  Although a wide range of cutting-edge methods are in the armoury of the OU – LIBS (Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy), FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared spectrosocopy), Raman spectroscopy, Spectro fluorometry, Remote sensing – its flagship is laser photoacoustic spectroscopy (LPAS).  In a typical LPAS system, a laser beam is modulated at an audio frequency and injected into a resonant cell where it hits the investigated sample that absorbs the incident radiation. Consequently, the part of the sample irradiated by the beam experiences a rise in temperature and volume, thus producing a pressure wave.  In general, the sound detection subsystem is made of a microphone connected with a lock-in amplifier synchronized with the modulator. The output signal is proportional to the sample absorption and typical experiments are conducted in the “fingerprint region”. Main advantages are rapidity, sensitivity, specificity, simplicity, repeatability, in situ measurement, uncomplicated sampling, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness. Current systems are robust and small, allowing to develop portable systems in industrial settings a portable system.
                    The OU will make available its smart sensors and devices to the end-user community, along with a spectroscopical database and a virtual Lab.</p>

                  <p>The OU brings together expertise in spectroscopic and microscopic characterisation as well as the preparation and characterisation of different micro/nano materials in food and environmental matrices. It also coordinates the Metrological Infrastructure for Food Safety (IMPreSA www.infrastrutturaimpresa.it)  with the aim of providing measurement and support to SMEs active in the field of active and intelligent food packaging development, and a project to support a <a href="https://www.euramet.org/european-metrology-networks/safe-and-sustainable-food">European Metrology Network for Safe and Sustainable Food</a> to harmonise the analytical methods. The OU has 300 m2 of laboratories dedicated to food contaminants analysis. The laboratories have comprehensive equipment for the physical and chemical characterisation of polymers, micro/ nano particles and surfaces. Specifically relevant are the micro-spectroscopic techniques, such as FTIR, Raman and Fluorescence microscopies, correlative and hyphenated spectroscopic techniques, such as AFM-Raman and AF4- DLS-Raman for the fractionation and identification of the polymer composition and for the measurement of the micro/nanoplastics. Moreover, advanced established analytical tools based on NMR, ICP-MS and LC-MS are further exploited for new methods development and metrological validation.</p>

                  <h4><strong>Description</strong></h4>
                  <p>The OU has an internationally recognised experience in the development of mathematical models and numerical tools for the simulation of physical phenomena in materials, devices, sensors and biological systems. This is achieved by integrating competences in numerical modelling, High-Performance Computing (HPC) and data analysis. Specific attention is devoted to the engineering and optimisation of the numerical tools to virtually reproduce as realistic as possible the physical phenomena investigated, with a high computational efficiency. To this aim, parallel computing based on Graphics Processing Units is exploited together with the implementation of advanced numerical methods. The OU operates in the framework of an already active computing infrastructure, equipped with a HPC cluster based on a hybrid CPU-GPU architecture, and workstations for software development, post-processing, data analysis and large-scale data storage. The expertise of the OU has been addressed to research activities that comprise the multiscale modelling of materials (down to the nanoscale) and the interactions of nanomaterials with biological systems. Within EURAMET, the OU is a member of the European Metrology Network for Mathematics and Statistics (Mathmet), which supports the application of mathematical and statistical tools in measurement science across Europe, and promotes the development of new research fields, like Artificial Intelligence.</p>
