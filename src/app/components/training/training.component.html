<div class="title"><h1>The Training Offer of METROFOOD-IT</h1></div>

<p>Intercepting all stakeholders in the agri-food sector: this is the fundamental goal of the training strategy pursued by the METROFOOD-IT Consortium. More specifically, the aim is to develop a comprehensive training plan, aligning educational programs with the mission to promote scientific excellence in food quality, authenticity, and safety, with a particular focus on transdisciplinarity.</p>
<p>To achieve this, training and education plans covering the project period and the future operation of the infrastructure are envisaged, with a ten-year perspective. The creation of a true HUB for "sustainable" innovation and training is also planned, involving experts from universities and research institutions. Specialized educational programs will be developed, supported by online learning tools, targeting university students and doctoral candidates, as well as relevant agri-food sector stakeholders, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, health research institutes, food inspection and control agencies, local and regional authorities, and citizens, following a public engagement approach. An integrated platform for education and training (LMS) will be created to offer open online courses (MOOCs) to a wide audience.</p>
<p>In more detail, the Training & Education (T&E) activities of the Consortium involve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Developing educational materials related to key scientific themes and R&D activities of the infrastructure (IR);</li>
  <li>Defining the structure of courses and training experiences to enhance the skills of various stakeholders, both in-person and remotely;</li>
  <li>Organizing a platform for disseminating these materials synchronously and asynchronously;</li>
  <li>Implementing a learning system connecting virtual experiences to the physical structures of the IR;</li>
  <li>Creating systems to access information from the IR's data platform and analyze them in "external" laboratory sessions;</li>
  <li>Enhancing existing doctoral courses at different partner universities with a transdisciplinary approach, including the implementation of a "new" METROFOOD-IT program.</li>
</ul>

<p>From an operational perspective, advanced technologies such as virtual classrooms will be employed to ensure an engaging experience. For academic staff, courses will cover technical aspects, enabling technologies, IoT, Blockchain, and Artificial Intelligence applied to agri-food, focusing on methodological aspects and techniques for implementing food chain traceability and transparency.</p>

<p>Trainees will have the opportunity to perform laboratory activities remotely, directly on their smartphones, tablets, and HoloLens, operating on 3D holograms of real instruments. Dedicated sessions will be proposed for analysts and laboratory technicians, researchers, potential entrepreneurs, private sector companies, citizens, and high school students.</p>

<p>Regarding the doctoral program, three positions for doctoral students targeted to METROFOOD-IT will be activated at UNIROMA1, UNINA, and UNIBA. Doctoral students will be supervised by professors from the three universities and will have the opportunity to virtually interact with other METROFOOD-IT stakeholders.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of all Consortium training and education activities is not only to improve the knowledge and skills of food chain actors and stakeholders but also to disseminate a systemic approach to address and solve problems related to sustainable development, involving citizens and structuring the role of METROFOOD-IT as a promoter of knowledge and skills development in support of the agri-food sector.</p>
